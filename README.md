# About SOURCE MICRO
## The idea

The SOURCE MICRO project is a collaborative FPV frame project initiated by BARD. The frame is donated to the community to empower creators and makers, and integrate best practices and current trends faster into a continuously manufactured product. In return, it allows the local distribution network to have cheap and direct access to a good frame in order to allow them compete in an increasingly predatory marketplace.

The hope is for this frame to enable broad access to FPV thanks to a low price point, great documentation and wide availability of compatible parts and accessories, without violating other people’s intellectual property.

## Project naming requirements
SOURCE MICRO is the name of the frame. If you are thinking about manufacturing it, you are expected to prefix the name with a brand name in order to allow customers to distinguish the different manufacturers, e.g. “TBS SOURCE MICRO”. As a manufacturer you are also expected to denote the version number of the frame files that you have placed as basis of the project, e.g. “TBS SOURCE MICRO V0.1”. 
If you have forked the project, you need to give it another name in order to avoid confusion between SOURCE MICRO and your project.
Accessories from the SOURCE MICRO project also need to be named with the entire prefix, e.g. “TBS SOURCE MICRO FPV Camera Adapter”. Unless the file is not compatible with certain versions of the frame, the compatible version number or version range also needs to be included in the name, e.g. “TBS SOURCE MICRO FPV Camera Adapter V0.1 - V2”
